Introduction
============

Welcome to the official documentation of Pynetics, a free and open source
library designed to work and experiment with Evolutionary Computation (EC)
algorithms.

This page gives a broad presentation of the library and how to work with it, so
it is a great starting point if you are a beginner.

Before you start
----------------

The :ref:`Examples <examples_index>` page lists some EC problems solved with
the library primitives. We consider it a good approach to learn what can be
accomplished with it and what are the main components available.

But if you have any trouble or suggestion, the best way to find help is through
one of the various :ref:`Community channels <community_channels>`.

About Pynetics
--------------

Pynetics is an effort to write a free and open source community-driven CE
library. This means that its development is open to everyone who wants to
collaborate, as long as its purposes and its community are respected.
