Community channels
==================

So, where can you ask for help in case something doesn't work?

For now, there's only two channels of communication, the `Discord Server
<https://discord.gg/Zb7fEvT>`_ and via email (yes, direct contact to me). I
hope that in the future there will be a cohesive community around the library.
I look forward to your comments and suggestions!
