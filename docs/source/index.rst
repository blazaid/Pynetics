Welcome to Pynetics
===================

Welcome to the official documentation of Pynetics, a free and open
source library designed to work and experiment with evolutionary
computation algorithms. If you are new to this documentation, we
recommend you to check the Getting started section to get an overview of
what this library has to offer.

This library is by no means finished (far from it), and I hope it never
is. Its goal is to continuously integrate more and more functionality
from the field of evolutionary computation, ranging from
well-established solutions to state-of-the-art advances.

The main documentation for the site is organized into the following
